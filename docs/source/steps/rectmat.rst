PSF Reconstruction (PSFR)

Description

TBD.


Algorithm
---------

Rectmat (or rectification matrix) is a calibration file used for the spectral extraction of the IFS lenslet data for a specific scale and filter. An individual rectmat contains information about each lenslets PSF as a function of wavelength. The rectmats are constructed from spectral white light scans, which scan each individual lenslet to determine their PSF and contribution to neighboring lensiets. This information can also be used to remove the variation from lenslet-to-lenslet, similar to a flat field.
