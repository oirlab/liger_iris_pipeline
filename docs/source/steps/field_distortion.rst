Field Distortion Correction
===========================

Description
-----------

TBD.


Algorithm
---------

The field distortion correction will correct the distortion in the imager field due to the optics of the system. These distortions can be chromatic and may need to be corrected per band. A calibration file with the distortion solution will be used using the distortion solution algorithm . The final image will need to be rectified and resampled based on the distortion solution. Software already exists to perform this task such as, SWarp, for rectifying and resampling the image based on the new distortion solution.
