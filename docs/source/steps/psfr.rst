PSF Reconstruction (PSFR)
=========================

Description
-----------

TBD.


Algorithm
---------

Knowledge of the PSF is essential in the reduction of AO data. However, this is challenging because of changing conditions (seeing) and the rate at which they change as well as the structure of the PSF. In order to reconstruct the PSF for a given observation, a simulated PSF from the NFIRAOS PSF simulator will be used to do the deconvolution on the imager and IFS.
