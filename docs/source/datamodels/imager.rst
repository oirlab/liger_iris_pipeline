Imager Rate Maps
================


Level 1
-------

Level 1 (L1) imager data are 2D electron rate (e-/s) maps. They are generated by the stage 1 pipeline, which handles a subset of detector-level calibrations and fits the UTR slopes to produce rate maps with computed uncertainties in e-/s. They have not been calibrated for dark, flat, sky subtraction, or distortion effects.

Level 2
-------

Level 2 (L2) imager data are 2D electron rate maps that have been calibrated for dark, flat, sky subtraction, and distortion effects. They are generated by the stage 2 pipeline.
